        <h2>Social Life</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>She is socially active and does a lot of voluntary activities. She Understands that Social Life Human beings are social animals, and the tenor of our social life is one of the most important influences on our mental health. Without positive,
                durable relationships, both our minds and our bodies fall apart. We begin life dependent for survival on the quality of relationship with our primary caregiver, usually Mom. And the nature of that relationship typically influences all
                others in our life. Our survival as a species similarly hinges on our capacity for social living. Most of human history was spent in small groups in which each was dependent on the others for survival, and evidence suggests this is the
                condition to which we are best adapted.

            <li>She is an active volunteer for the Art of Living Foundation who is a non-profit organization involved inn all kinds of voluntary activies mainly yoga and meditation. EXISTENCE is a FACT, LIVING is an ART that needs to be learned. Yoga is often
                considered to be a physical exercise, but this is just a beginning. Physical exercise is simply an aspect of it. Next comes the breath, and the mind. Without tapping the inner source of energy through meditation, Yoga is never complete.
                Sudarshan Kriya, a powerful breathing technique taught on the Art of Living course, takes you to the deepest meditation where body, mind and breath converge into one rhythm, connecting to the source of life within.
